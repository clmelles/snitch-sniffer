# The Golden Snitch Sniffer

 This is a project that uses multiple long-range ultrasonic sensors to find and track
 an object flying in three-dimensional space. It displays the object's coordinates,
 speed, and trajectory through a VR headset.
 It's a demo to use a Raspberry Pi in combination with Github.
